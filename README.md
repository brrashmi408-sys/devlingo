# DevLingo

DevLingo is a developer tool that explains programming errors in simple, human-friendly language and translates those explanations into the developer’s native language using Lingo.dev.

## Problem
Programming errors are often cryptic and only available in English, making them hard to understand—especially for beginners and non-native English speakers.

## Solution
DevLingo converts raw runtime errors into clear explanations and dynamically localizes them into multiple languages at runtime using the Lingo.dev SDK.

## Tech Stack
- Frontend: (to be added)
- Backend: (to be added)
- Localization: Lingo.dev SDK

## Status
🚧 Work in progress (built for the Lingo.dev Hackathon)
